   Add To Current Playlist
      Add at the end of the :ref:`current_playlist`. Hidden if already in the playlist.

   Add And Play
      Add at the end of the :ref:`current_playlist` and start playing the first track. Hidden if
      already in the playlist.

   Play
      Play the track right away without adding it in the current playlist. This is useful to quickly
      listen to a track without messing with the playlist.

   Reorder
      When the handle is displayed at the left of a list, it means that the elements can be
      manually reordered.
