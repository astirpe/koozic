Playlists
=========

KooZic has extended playlist creation capabilities. It is possible to create playlist manually by
adding tracks, albums or artists, but dynamic playlist are also available.


Views
-----

A :term:`Tree`, a :term:`Form` and a :term:`Search` view.


Actions
-------

3 action buttons are available:

* :term:`Purge`
* :term:`Download`
* :term:`Create Link`

In edit mode, several fields appear. By adding an album or an artist, all the corresponding tracks
are added to the playlist. A dynamic playlist is automatically populated when switching tracks.
Therefore, in this case, it is usually not necessary to add more than a few tracks before starting
playing it.

Finally, it is also possible to interact with the playlist lines:

* :term:`Reorder`
* :term:`Play`


Fields
------

A selection of relevant track :ref:`track_fields` are displayed.
