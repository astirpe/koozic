Converters
==========

A converter is a task which converts tracks to a defined format. Many softwares provide such a
functionality (convert FLAC to MP3, MP3 to OGG...), and the KooZic converter is provided for
convenience only. It is not intended to be a real alternative to dedicated softwares. However, since
KooZic uses FFMpeg for music transcoding, a converter was a straightforward tool to include.

Creating a list of tracks to convert is very similar to the way :ref:`playlists` work. Once the
list is created, launch the conversion process and retreive the files in the directory set.


Views

A :term:`Tree`, a :term:`Form` and a :term:`Search` view.


Actions
-------

2 action buttons are available:

* :term:`Run`
* :term:`Purge`

In edit mode, several fields appear. By adding an album, an artist or a playlist, all the
corresponding tracks are added to the converter.

It is also possible to interact with the lines:

* :term:`Reorder`
