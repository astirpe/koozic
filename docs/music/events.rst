Events
======

The events of the followed :ref:`artists` are aggregated in this menu. The definition of the current
location and the maximum distance for events is set in the :ref:`user_preferences`. This is very
useful to avoid noise in the list of events.

The events are obtained thanks to BandsInTown and updated automatically every 2 weeks.


Views
-----

A :term:`Tree`, a :term:`Calendar`, a :term:`Form` and a :term:`Search` view.

The tree view is grouped by month by default. The number of events (specified between parenthesis)
may be wrong if a maximum distance for events is set. Indeed, the exact count is computed when the
group is expanded.
